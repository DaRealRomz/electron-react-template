# Electron React Template

This is a basic template to develop Electron applications in TypeScript with React. This template uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to build your code and [Electron Builder](https://www.electron.build/) to package it.

Use `npm start` to start developing and `npm run build` to package your app for production.
